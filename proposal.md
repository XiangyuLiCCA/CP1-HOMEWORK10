Arduino Keyboard Penbeat Robot

Assembling a robot with Arduino that can play my midterm project, keyboard penbeat, by itself. 

Summary

This robot has six paws, each paw is responsible for one of the numbers 1-6 on keyboard. Also, through programming, I can pre-enter the scores of my mid-term project keyboard penbeat so that the robot can play the songs by itself.
